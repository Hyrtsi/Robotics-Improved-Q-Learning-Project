# Robotics-Improved-Q-Learning-Project
Implementation of IQL Algorithm. Based on IQL by Konar et al. (2012).

- Course project work
- Matlab script, IQLAlgorithm.m, to run for path planning of a simulated robot
- The script has some functions made, downloading them all and running in Matlab 2016a -> should work off-the-shelf.
- Implementation of the research paper: A Deterministic Improved Q-Learning for Path Planning of a Mobile Robot by Amit Konar; Indrani Goswami Chakraborty; Sapam Jitu Singh; Lakhmi C. Jain; Atulya K. Nagar
